# Final Project Ideas

## Wellness Event Site
Similar to the functionality of "10k a Day" (the Liberty Mutual step counting challenge) but supporting events beyond steps / day.
* Admin capabilities to CRUD events
* User sign up and participation in events
* Aggregation of user data for events (5k, biking, etc)
* Integration with activity tracker / site data (fitbit? something comparable for iPhone data? something for biking?)
* Integration with social media (push participation data to facebook)
* Gamification - accrue points based on participation

## Financial Planning Education
A tool to educate K-12 users on the impact of financial planning - early exposure to the modeling tools that 
typically are available through employment.
* Mock investment accounts, tied to actual market performance
*
